# HangmanGame

The hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over. 


Set a maximum limit for guesses to 10. 
Set the correct answer to: ‘GirlCode’ 
For each correct alphabet the user guesses, display the letter in the correct placeholder and disable the selected alphabet. 
For each incorrect alphabet the user guesses, disable the selected alphabet. 
Display the remaining number of guesses to the player after each wrong attempt. 
Have a ‘Hint’ button that displays a hint when the user clicks it: Hint: “It is an organisation that hosted the largest all female hackathon in South Africa” 
When the user displays the correct answer, display the message: “You win!” 
After 10 attends: display the message: “You Lose!”
